# personal-project
* Start-a-town! (working title)
* 2d isometric pixel-art voxel colony sim
* Angelo Tsimidakis personal project preview code
* Work in progress

# History
Intrigued by game concepts like The Sims and Dwarf Fortress, began playing around with Game Maker in 2008 with only some basic coding knowledge. A few years later started from scratch in C# with Microsoft XNA. Game concept went from farming sim, to "pixel-art isometric minecraft", to colony sim, with the latest direction specifically being an "RPG town simulator whereas you manage the town member's skills, needs, and relationships, to provide rpg-like services to out of town visitors/heroes, such as trading, resting, repairing, training, healing, questing, and more".

# Goal
Realizing how overscoped this project is for one person, I rationalized continuing working on it as a hobby by setting these goals: 
1. Finish this project and release as a commercial game given enough time
2. Develop scalable and modular components that can be reused for a smaller game, should an idea come up
3. Develop skills to be utilized for finding a job as a game (ideally) developer, in case a career change was in order

#
* Systems being iterated upon as needs arise
* Being worked on on and off as a hobby project

# Workflow
* Iterating on different systems in a rotation in order to prevent burn-out

# Current state
* Still a lot of legacy code from early iterations that is slowly phased out/refactored, in order to not break everything at once
