# History
Intrigued by game concepts like The Sims and Dwarf Fortress, began playing around with Game Maker in 2008 with only some basic coding knowledge. A few years later and with a little more experience, started from scratch in C# with Microsoft XNA. Game concept went from farming sim, to "pixel-art isometric minecraft", to colony sim, with the latest direction specifically being an "RPG town simulator whereas you manage the town member's skills, needs, and relationships, to provide rpg-like services to out of town visitors/heroes, such as trading, resting, repairing, training, healing, questing, and more".

* Systems being iterated upon as needs arise
* Being worked on on and off as a hobby project
